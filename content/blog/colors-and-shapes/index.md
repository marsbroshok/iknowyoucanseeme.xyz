## Chasing Light: My View on Color and Shape

### Finding the Quirky Moments

Hey, I'm Alexander (@iknowyoucanseeme.xyz). I'm that coffee-fueled, pixel-obsessed photographer you might find trying to capture life's quirky moments. I have a thing for lens flares and maybe even imagining what trees might say. For me, photography is about seeing the world a little differently, especially its colors and shapes.

### Whispers, Wings, and Pastel Skies

Inspiration often comes unexpectedly. Think of those walks where the tides seem to whisper, and you find yourself tracing the flight of dreamy birds overhead. Sometimes it feels like you've got a rainbow in your head, looking up at a sky that seems determined to share its pastel secrets. It’s *those* feelings I try to hold onto.

### Chasing Atmospheric Color

Color is pure emotion, isn't it? I'm always chasing those soft, pastel hues the sky reveals at dawn, or the deep, moody blues of twilight. I love capturing how rainbows can unexpectedly fracture light across water or through the air. It's all about bottling that fleeting magic, that specific atmospheric mood, pixel by pixel.

### The Dance of Shapes

Shapes are just as fascinating. I love the contrast between a sharp silhouette – like a pylon against the sky – and the soft blur of those dreamy birds in motion. Light itself takes shape too: beams cutting through haze, intricate patterns shimmering on water, or even that signature lens flare adding its own geometry. It's a constant visual conversation.

### My Visual Language

Ultimately, I use color and shape to translate these feelings and fleeting moments into something tangible. It's my attempt to share those whispered secrets and atmospheric vibes I encounter. Think of it as my personal visual diary – just some art, maybe paired with a few weird captions along the way.
